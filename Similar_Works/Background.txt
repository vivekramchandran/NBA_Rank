This file is to give a little background and a short summary of some of the papers 
that have attempted to do similar steps or use similar processes.

Team_Sport_Data.pdf
  It is very difficult to analyze team sports due to their free flowing nature, as well as the high
number of movement and actions that are very difficult to track as well as rate.  This article gives
insight into how to do team analysis.  Namely, both movevement tracking and event tracking are necessary
to accrue the necessary data, and than certain data modelling and mining tools must be used to analyze the
data.  This is not a very technical paper, but it does a good job of explaining why team sports cannot be
properly analyzed using the normal statistics that are recorded.

Expected_Possession_Value.pdf
  This paper takes an interesting approach on modelling and essentially "monetizing" all actions that occur
during a possession for an offensive team.  Using the same data that this project will use, this model involves
a fully continuous model combined with a coarsened model (using Markov chains) to determine Expected Possession 
Value based on which player has the ball and in what position he is in.  What is of value from this paper
is the methods they use to parse the data, as well as their unique approach of combining two models, with one
of them being continuous.  This project will use a similar approach
