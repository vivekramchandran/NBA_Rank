  It is very difficult to analyze team sports due to their free flowing nature, as well as the high
number of movement and actions that are very difficult to track as well as rate.  This article gives
insight into how to do team analysis.  Namely, both movevement tracking and event tracking are necessary
to accrue the necessary data, and than certain data modelling and mining tools must be used to analyze the
data.  This is not a very technical paper, but it does a good job of explaining why team sports cannot be
properly analyzed using the normal statistics that are recorded.
